# Using SPO triplets for opinion mining
This repository is dedicated to researching ways of improving opinion mining methods. We are set to prove that using SPO triplets with topic models in the task of opinion mining provides an increase in quality.

Currently there are several jupyter notebooks with conducted reasearch in this repository. The notebook lnr_dnr.ipynb studies news on enterprise nationalization in LNR and DNR. The file lnr_dnr_labelled is the dataset used for evaluation. 
The notebook trump.ipynb is on the same research with the corpus about Trump leaving the Paris Agreement.

To run the notebooks you need to have a docker container with SyntaxNet.
